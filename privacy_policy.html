    <h4>B. Information from Third-Party Platforms (Instagram & TikTok)</h4>

        <li><strong>To Communicate With You:</strong> To send you service-related announcements, updates, security alerts, and support messages.</li>
        <li><strong>For Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> To protect our App, our users, and the public from fraudulent, malicious, or illegal activity.</li>
        <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> To adhere to applicable laws, regulations, and the platform policies of Instagram and TikTok.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Content You Post Through Our App</h2>
    <p>When you schedule and post content to Instagram or TikTok using our App, that content ("User Content") is sent to the respective platform. This User Content is then subject to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy of that platform. We are a service provider acting on your behalf, and we are not responsible for how Instagram or TikTok handles your User Content after it has been published.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We are committed to not selling your personal information. We may share your information only in the following limited circumstances:</p>

        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share information if you give us your explicit consent to do so.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with trusted third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., cloud hosting, payment processing) under strict confidentiality agreements.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal and Safety Reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if we believe it's required to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p><strong>Security:</strong> We implement robust technical and organizational security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no internet transmission is 100% secure.</p>
    <p><strong>Retention:</strong> We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with our services. We may also retain information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Data obtained from Instagram and TikTok, particularly cached analytics data, is periodically refreshed, and outdated data is deleted. If you disconnect your social media account or delete your App account, we will delete the associated platform data from our active databases in accordance with our data deletion cycle.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have rights over your personal data. Depending on your location, these may include the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access, Correct, or Delete</strong> your personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Object to or Restrict</strong> our processing of your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Request a copy of your data in a machine-readable format.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdraw Consent:</strong> Revoke your consent for us to access your platform data at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>How to Revoke Access:</strong></h4>

            <li><strong>For Instagram:</strong> Go to your Instagram profile -> Settings -> Security -> Apps and Websites.</li>
            <li><strong>For TikTok:</strong> Go to your TikTok profile -> Settings and privacy -> Security and login -> Manage app permissions.</li>
        </ul>
    Revoking access will prevent us from accessing further data, but we will retain data collected previously in line with our retention policy.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our services are not directed to individuals under the age of 13 (or a higher age if stipulated by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the one you reside in. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country. We take appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
